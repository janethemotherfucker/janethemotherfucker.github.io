  <h1>Computers are too easy</h1>
   <p>Computers are too easy to use. I think Steve Jobs and Bill Gates did disservice to the computer industry. Some people are saying I&rsquo;m wrong and that it&rsquo;s Apple and Microsoft that made computers what they are today. I say they are wrong. Apple and Microsoft may be putting out these innovative solutions but they are not creating them.</p>
<p>Microsoft does not make products, it buys them and makes changes to them so they are more user friendly, insecure and inferior to competing products. Microsoft&rsquo;s secret to success was when Bill Gates sold IBM a piece of software he didn&rsquo;t even own. He used their money to buy CP/M and made MS-DOS.</p>
<p><img src="/images/fwm75e3wiaa99kj.avif" alt=""></p>
<p>The computer industry of today was partially Microsoft. The biggest impact on the computer industry is Gaming. Games push the hardware and games push the software. A computer built in 2007 can still be used for word processing, spreadsheets, web development and browsing. You don&rsquo;t need a 2GB graphics card to browse the web.</p>
<p>Now, thanks to Microsoft, anybody can use a computer, which means all sorts of idiots will be on the Internet. Part of this blame also goes to the folks who created America Online (A perfect name). Anybody in America can now get online, just give them twice the amount of money that you would give another ISP. Then they can show the world that they can&rsquo;t spell worth shit. That&rsquo;s another problem with these idiot users is that they can&rsquo;t spell.</p>
<p>MSN/AOL/Yahoo/ICQ are full of losers who can&rsquo;t spell a god damned word. They say stuff like &ldquo;g0d d@m u lol&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Back in the old days when DOS ruled the home, it kicked more ass. When a user made a mistake, the computer threw a big incoherent error at them which made them fear it. Now they get big huge buttons and music.</p>
<p><img src="/images/retro.avif" alt=""></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think DOS did a good enough job so I decided to modify an open source command.com (FreeCom, which is used in FreeDOS) to make it more user unfriendly. Errors are generated with curse words to scare them even more than MS-DOS/PC-DOS did.</p>
<p>If I had it my way, every time a user made a mistake the operating system would throw a few viruses into the mix. Every time the user made a configuration error it would wipe their computer.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thinking of making a keyboard that has all sorts of shortcuts for users. A really user friendly looking keyboard, but if they press any of those keys it will fucking electrocute them.</p>
<p>I just had an even better idea, a haptic suit that is required to use the Internet. Then if someone says something stupid like &ldquo;Hitler did nothing wrong&rdquo; or &ldquo;vaccines don&rsquo;t work&rdquo;, someone would be able to punch them in the fucking stomach, over the Internet. That would be kick ass. You could literally do that.</p>
