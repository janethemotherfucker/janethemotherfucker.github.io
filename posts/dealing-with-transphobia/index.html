  <h1>Dealing with Transphobia</h1>
   <p>I see a lot of fucking hate aimed at the transgender community by assholes and shitheads. And sometimes these shitheads make a video of a trans person freaking out.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t freak out. You don&rsquo;t want to be put on blast by fascists.</p>
<p>I have a better solution.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Hello Sir, how can I help you?&rdquo; says some guy</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a Sir&rdquo; says a trans woman</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t give me that gender nonsense. You&rsquo;re a biological male and you can&rsquo;t force me to use pronouns&rdquo; says the guy</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just remain calm. They&rsquo;re trolling you. Surprise the shit out of that fuckface.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Ma&rsquo;am, go fuck yourself. Study some advanced biology dipshit and serve me my fucking food&rdquo; says the trans woman, calmly and pleasantly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That&rsquo;s right! Just swear at the fucker, but do it nicely, gracefully. You&rsquo;ll get the same point across.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Trans men are women, trans women are men&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;re a fucking douchebag, and you&rsquo;re wrong. Read a fucking book shithead.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>See how easy it is? These fuckfaces just got owned.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not transphobic, I&rsquo;m not afraid of trans people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen here fuckface, transphobia means the aversion and prejudice against trans people. Go read a fucking dictionary idiot&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>More fucking examples.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just LGB, the T is just mentally ill&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know who is mentally ill, mother fucker? You. There wouldn&rsquo;t be an LGB without us, Stonewall was a fucking riot&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I fucking hate these bigots.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;TERF is redundant, just remove the T, E, F and just call them feminists&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey douche bag, real feminists aren&rsquo;t exclusionary. You&rsquo;re just a fucking bigot and an asshole. Go fuck yourself&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also, there is nothing wrong with calling these fucking people for being fascists because they are fascists. If you look at trans acceptance through a lens of political parties, you find out republicans/conservatives/right-wingers are against it and they are the biggest fucking fascists.</p>
<p>These things fucking work online too, so take advantage of it. This one always work:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Not only did I fuck the shit out of your mom, but I also programmed the fucking Large Hadron Collider to open up a god damned parallel universe to get a copy of myself. We then jumped into a time machine so we could both gang bang her in the past and we are both your mom too motherfucker!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I with this fucking article was better. Eat a fucking bag of dicks.</p>
<p>Transphobia is for nitwits and assholes, fuckface.</p>
<p>Oooooo, I almost forgot the bathroom debate.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not against trans people, I just don&rsquo;t want biological men in the women&rsquo;s bathroom and I don&rsquo;t want biological women in the bathroom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too fucking bad fuckface, trans women are women and trans men are men. Read a fucking advanced biology textbook sometime instead of your shitty grade 5 biology bullshit&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There we go. Have a nice day :)</p>
