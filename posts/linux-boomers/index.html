  <h1>Linux Boomers</h1>
   <p>I&rsquo;m going to start this article off by saying that you don&rsquo;t have to be born in the boomer generation to be a boomer. You can be a boomer by acting like one. Hate new stuff? boomer. Run a desktop from the naughties? Boomer.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right fuckface.</p>
<p>Linux Boomers are people who act like boomers because they hate new things. They thought the naughties were the pinnacle of technology and say OSS was the best. They complain about ALSA, they complain about pulseaudio and they complained about systemd.</p>
<p>The new stuff just works and looks better. Things are easier now than they were before, unless you&rsquo;re some Linux Boomer who refuses to learn new things because you don&rsquo;t want to update your 30 year old bash scripts.</p>
<p>Check this shit out, this is Gnome in the naughties:</p>
<p><img src="/images/debian-lenny-desktop.avif" alt=""></p>
<p>This desktop was the top of the line in the naughties. It was great, I&rsquo;ll admit that. Back in the day I switched from KDE 3 to Gnome 2 because it looked better and it fucking kicked ass.</p>
<p>Gnome 3 came out and totally changed everything. I didn&rsquo;t like it at first and I switched to KDE 4, like a mother fucker. People hated that shit too but whatever, those people are idiots.</p>
<p>Then MATE Desktop came out, and what does it look like today?</p>
<p><img src="/images/how-to-install-remove-mate-desktop-environment-in-kali-linux-blackmore-ops.avif" alt=""></p>
<p>The fucking same shit from the naughties.</p>
<p>Anyone running MATE Desktop today is a Linux boomer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hate new technology, I just want to run the same desktop until the end of fucking time&rdquo;</p>
<p>Great, do whatever you want. Just shut the fuck up about it, nobody cares.</p>
<p>I switched from Linux to macOS for a number of years and it was fucking awesome. Then my Macbook Pro became defective and I bought a PC and went back to Linux.</p>
<p>Shit is much better now, wayland, systemd, pipewire and gnome 3. It fucking kicks ass.</p>
<p><img src="/images/screenshot-from-2023-12-26-13-50-27.avif" alt=""></p>
<p>This desktop just fucking rocks. Gnome 45 is awesome. I use Dash to Panel and some system tray notification extension. It fixed everything I didn&rsquo;t like about Gnome. Now I&rsquo;m balling out like a mother fucker. I&rsquo;m getting shit done.</p>
<p>What do I use? Arch Linux. I want the latest software and I&rsquo;m not one of those Linux Boomer assholes who wants &ldquo;stable&rdquo; shit.</p>
<p>Stable just means old. It&rsquo;s not better, it&rsquo;s just <em>old</em>.</p>
<p>I use Wayland, systemd, systemd-boot, pipewire, btrfs with zstd compression and luks encryption, a modern laptop with an NVMe and USB-C.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fucking cool. These Linux boomers are fucking idiots.</p>
<p>I had an argument with someone in #fsf on Libera Chat who thought he was more free because he ran some core2duo from 2007 on 3GB of ram.</p>
<p>Dude, I had 4GB of ram on my core2duo back then because I fucking love technology. I want the best shit, &ldquo;just good enough&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t just good enough for me.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t have a problem with people who want to use old computers and old technology. We get it, you&rsquo;re a Linux boomer, just shut the fuck up about it. Nobody gives a shit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re running Waylandows&rdquo; -some douche</p>
<p>Listen here fuckface, new shit kicks ass.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t like Wayland, don&rsquo;t use it. If you have a problem with Redhat no longer putting money into it, then eat a dick. Go fork xorg and use that for another 50 years.</p>
<p>XWayland exists so you can run your obsolete shit. Want to use X Forwarding over SSH? it just fucking works. Stop being a fuckface.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t like where Linux is going, just go fucking write your own operating system or use something else. Nobody is forcing you to use Linux, and even if you need Linux, there are options. Go use Devuan, or Void Linux, or GUIX, or some stupid shit like that.</p>
<p><img src="/images/devuan_screenshot_xfce4_desktop.avif" alt=""></p>
<p>I looked up Devuan screenshots and here you go fuckface, XFCE still looks like it did in the naughties. Enjoy your old shit.</p>
<p>You can still be a Linux boomer. Just shut the fuck up about it.</p>
<p>When its 2050, I&rsquo;ll be enjoying Gnome 99 on my VR headset banging prostitutes in virtual reality. I will emulate your setup in a virtual machine just for the fucking lulz because I&rsquo;ll have 128TB of ram on my quantum computer like a boss.</p>
<p><img src="/images/cosmos_fitness_3092.avif" alt=""></p>
<p>I fucked your mom in VR!</p>
<p><em>Notice: I converted all my images to avif just to piss off the Linux boomers.</em></p>
