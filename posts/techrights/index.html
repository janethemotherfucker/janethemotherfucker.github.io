  <h1>Techrights is a nazi adjacent cesspool</h1>
   <p>It might be a little inaccurate to label the site &ldquo;Nazi&rdquo; when it&rsquo;s really fascist and/or Nazi adjacent. Saying something is adjacent is like saying it&rsquo;s similar, but not quite the same. It&rsquo;s basically in the same area.</p>
<p>Techrights claims to be progressive but it isn&rsquo;t. When has Techrights ever leaned left?</p>
<p>This is from 2011:</p>
<p><img src="/images/ronpaul.avif" alt="Ron Paul">
<a href="https://techrights.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/irc-log-techrights-15092011.html">Citation Link</a></p>
<p>Techrights is always writing shitty articles based on disinformation and bald faced lies but they covered a leak of <a href="https://techrights.org/n/2023/12/23/These_Leaks_From_Red_Hat_Make_People_Very_Upset_However_It_Has_.shtml">Redhat&rsquo;s hiring guidelines</a>.</p>
<p>Roy &ldquo;Fuckface&rdquo; Schestowitz, the owner, seems to be saying that these policies are racist. Redhat just wants to do the right thing and hire minorities. It is not racist to fuck with the oppressors and work within the system to undo systemic racism.</p>
<p>&ldquo;White genocide! White erasure!&rdquo; fascists generally say. Lunduke loves that kind of shit.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I am pretty sure that this hate site is Nazi adjacent, misogynistic, transphobic, white supremacist AND fascist. It is swimming in phobia soup!</p>
<p><img src="/images/hackerman.avif" alt="Hacker man"></p>
<p>Techrights started out as a good news site that reported on Novell&rsquo;s secret deals with Microsoft, and gained popularity when it criticized Ubuntu for including shitty Mono applications. These applications were based on Microsoft&rsquo;s C# Language and .Net platform.</p>
<p>It devolved from that to paranoia and batshit insane conspiracy theories. It&rsquo;s possible that I&rsquo;m wrong and that they were always a bunch of fucking lunatics.</p>
<p>Roy Schestowitz is the Alex Jones of the Free Software community, and Techrights is Infowars.</p>
<p><img src="/images/alex-jones.avif" alt=""></p>
<p>But &ldquo;Dr&rdquo; Schestowitz goes much further than Jones. He runs an IRC channel full of hate.</p>

<p>This is just untrue. First of all, in case you didn&rsquo;t know, Schestowitz calls Youtube, &ldquo;Gulagtube.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are a fuck tonne of videos of all races of women shaking their booties.</p>

<p>Check out that M.I.L.F Money :3</p>
<p>Roy just has a problem with black people doing it, and attributes it to some fucking batshit insane conspiracy by Google and the mainstream media.</p>
<p>And here is more bullshit from the team:</p>

<p>Seems like that IS &ldquo;gfoing&rdquo; into eugenics. Is there a gene for stupid fucking typos? Roy is such a dipshit.</p>
<p>Why are Free Software &ldquo;advocates&rdquo; <a href="/posts/richard-stallman-loves-eugenics/">always embracing eugenics</a>? Kinda weird.</p>
<p>Roy doesn&rsquo;t seem to have a fucking problem with this kind of racism and shit on his IRC channel, which he publishes on his shitty news site.</p>

<p>&ldquo;later it became Chelsea&rdquo; - Roy Schestowitz.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I hate how these classy motherfuckers use the word &ldquo;it&rdquo; in relation to a trans person and try to deny that deadnaming is transphobia.</p>
<p>What a bunch of Nazi adjacent fucks.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadnaming">Deadnaming</a> is the act of referring to a transgender or non-binary person by a name they used prior to transitioning, such as their birth name. Deadnaming may be unintentional, or a deliberate attempt to deny, mock or invalidate a person&rsquo;s gender identity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Trust me, it&rsquo;s a fucking cesspool of hate.</p>
<p>Check out the official desk of Techrights:</p>
<p><img src="/images/checkmate.avif" alt="checkmate"></p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>What is the moral of the story? Techrights are just a bunch of Nazi adjacent fascist white supremacist fucks who hate women, minorities and LGBTQ2 people.</p>
