  <h1>Richard Stallman loves Eugenics</h1>
   <p>I was reading some nonsense from the fuckfaces over at the <a href="https://stallmansupport.org/debunking-false-accusations-against-richard-stallman.html#ableist">Stallman Support</a> website. They attempt to apologize for Stallman&rsquo;s shitty behavior by explaining away why he is such a fucking monster.</p>
<p><img src="/images/screenshot-from-2023-11-30-01-31-22-1.avif" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Just take a second to read this bullshit., dipshit</strong></p>
<p>First paragraph: <strong><em>abort fetuses that have Down&rsquo;s syndrome</em></strong></p>
<p>This is fucking eugenics bruh, plain and fucking simple. I&rsquo;m not arguing about the definition of a person here motherfucker, I&rsquo;m arguing against eugenics.</p>
<p>Stallman literally thinks that this test should be used to erase fetuses with down&rsquo;s syndrome by suggesting to parents that they ought to abort these fetuses before they become a burden.</p>
<p>People with down syndrome are great fucking people. Leave them the fuck alone. They did this in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_euthanasia_in_Nazi_Germany">Nazi Fucking Germany</a>.</p>
<p>Yeah, I get it. It&rsquo;s a fucking fetus, but it&rsquo;s the same god damned thing that Hitler did. Instead of lethal injections or gassing a person with down&rsquo;s syndrome, you&rsquo;re terminating a fetus that <em><strong>might</strong></em> have it. Same god damn fucking result. Same god damn fucking objective.</p>
<p>And hey, I&rsquo;m not against abortion, asshole. Women (and trans men) should have the right to terminate a pregnancy. But they shouldn&rsquo;t be <strong><em>encouraged</em></strong> to do so because the fetus <em><strong>might</strong></em> grow into a child with a disability, dipshit.</p>
<p>If you normalize this, what&rsquo;s next? It won&rsquo;t stop here at down&rsquo;s syndrome.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh your child is going to have autism, we better abort it! Children with autism are a huge burden!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Far fetched? <a href="https://www.parents.com/pregnancy/my-baby/pregnancy-and-autism-what-you-need-to-know/#:~:text=While%20autism%20is%20typically%20not,heart%2C%20head%2C%20and%20kidneys.">Here is an article about how the concept of detecting autism in the womb is getting closer to reality</a>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh your child might end up being gay, better abort that fetus!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is no &ldquo;gay gene&rdquo;, I know! <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2019/08/29/theres-no-gay-gene-genetics-are-linked-same-sex-behavior-new-study-says/">But look at this too</a>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems that your fetus has grown a penis and it is being bombarded by female hormones and the brain seems to be developing as a female. Your child <em>might</em> end up being TRANSGENDER! Oh no! Better abort it! What a burden!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is a lot of controversy around detecting trans people in the womb, but <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/02/200205084203.htm">scientists are studying it</a>. There are a lot of fucking bigot parents out there who would rather abort a fetus than to have a transgender daughter or son.</p>
<p>Before you say &ldquo;slippery slope argument&rdquo; fuckface, check out the <a href="https://www.hmd.org.uk/learn-about-the-holocaust-and-genocides/what-is-genocide/the-ten-stages-of-genocide/">Ten Stages of Genocide</a> and go fuck yourself.</p>
