    <h2><a href="/posts/shocking-truth-exposed-the-dark-underbelly-of-techrights-unveiling-its-secret-far-right-ties-and-hate-filled-agenda/">The Dark Underbelly of Techrights - Unveiling Its Hate-Filled Agenda</a></h2>
    The first fucking thing you might say about this is &ldquo;No shit, fuckface, Techrights has hated Microsoft forever&rdquo; and that&rsquo;s the truth. But it goes much deeper than this. They don&rsquo;t just hate Microsoft and other corporations that have monopolies.
It might be a little inaccurate to label the site &ldquo;Nazi&rdquo; too when it&rsquo;s really fascist and/or Nazi adjacent. Saying something is adjacent is like saying it&rsquo;s similar, but not quite the same.
  
    <h2><a href="/posts/eating-meat-kicks-ass/">Eating meat kicks ass</a></h2>
    Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I fucking love animals&hellip;. with the right seasoning.
Enjoy a picture of a stupid animal being eaten.
I was chilling in IRC eating dry roasted BBQ crickets, when some fuckface vegan started calling me a murderer.
&ldquo;Meat is genocide&rdquo; they kept saying, over and over again, for weeks.
Let&rsquo;s have a look at the dictionary:
T he deliberate and systematic destruction of a racial, political, or cultural group
  
    <h2><a href="/posts/computers-are-too-easy/">Computers are too easy</a></h2>
    Computers are too easy to use. I think Steve Jobs and Bill Gates did disservice to the computer industry. Some people are saying I&rsquo;m wrong and that it&rsquo;s Apple and Microsoft that made computers what they are today. I say they are wrong. Apple and Microsoft may be putting out these innovative solutions but they are not creating them.
Microsoft does not make products, it buys them and makes changes to them so they are more user friendly, insecure and inferior to competing products.
  
    <h2><a href="/posts/linux-boomers/">Linux Boomers</a></h2>
    I&rsquo;m going to start this article off by saying that you don&rsquo;t have to be born in the boomer generation to be a boomer. You can be a boomer by acting like one. Hate new stuff? boomer. Run a desktop from the naughties? Boomer.
That&rsquo;s right fuckface.
Linux Boomers are people who act like boomers because they hate new things. They thought the naughties were the pinnacle of technology and say OSS was the best.
  
    <h2><a href="/posts/debunking-eben-moglen-s-2012-prediction-how-facebook-now-meta-defied-expectations-over-the-past-decade/">Debunking Eben Moglen&#39;s 2012 Prediction: How Facebook, Now Meta, Defied Expectations Over the Past Decade</a></h2>
    In 2012, Eben &ldquo;Fuckface&rdquo; Moglen, a fucking shitty legal scholar and god damned stupid privacy advocate, made a bold prediction that Facebook would face a decade of challenges. Not fucking true motherfuckers.
Fast forward to today, and it&rsquo;s clear that Moglen&rsquo;s insane forecast did not stand up to the test of fucking time. This literary masterpiece fucking delves into the context of Moglen&rsquo;s shitty prediction, explores the reasons behind it, and analyzes how Facebook, now Meta, not only weathered the storm but emerged like a mother fucker.
  
    <h2><a href="/posts/dealing-with-transphobia/">Dealing with Transphobia</a></h2>
    I see a lot of fucking hate aimed at the transgender community by assholes and shitheads. And sometimes these shitheads make a video of a trans person freaking out.
Don&rsquo;t freak out. You don&rsquo;t want to be put on blast by fascists.
I have a better solution.
&ldquo;Hello Sir, how can I help you?&rdquo; says some guy
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a Sir&rdquo; says a trans woman
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t give me that gender nonsense.
  
    <h2><a href="/posts/swearing-is-cruise-control-for-cool-shithead/">Swearing is cruise control for cool, shithead</a></h2>
    That&rsquo;s right, fuckface!
&ldquo;uuuououououo thats offensive!&rdquo;
Fuck off.
There is nothing fucking wrong with using &ldquo;bad words&rdquo; and in fact, they add some god damned emphasis and make your use of language so much more badass.
The best music and movies are full of profanity. Rap music is cool as shit!
Can you imagine if NWA made a song called &ldquo;Screw the police.&rdquo; It would be fucking boring and lame. Good job Donny Osmond, idiots.
  
    <h2><a href="/posts/richard-stallman-loves-eugenics/">Richard Stallman loves Eugenics</a></h2>
    I was reading some nonsense from the fuckfaces over at the Stallman Support website. They attempt to apologize for Stallman&rsquo;s shitty behavior by explaining away why he is such a fucking monster.
Just take a second to read this bullshit., dipshit
First paragraph: abort fetuses that have Down&rsquo;s syndrome
This is fucking eugenics bruh, plain and fucking simple. I&rsquo;m not arguing about the definition of a person here motherfucker, I&rsquo;m arguing against eugenics.
