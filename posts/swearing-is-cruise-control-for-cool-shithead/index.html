  <h1>Swearing is cruise control for cool, shithead</h1>
   <p>That&rsquo;s right, fuckface!</p>
<p>&ldquo;uuuououououo thats offensive!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fuck off.</p>
<p>There is nothing fucking wrong with using &ldquo;bad words&rdquo; and in fact, they add some god damned emphasis and make your use of language so much more badass.</p>
<p>The best music and movies are full of profanity. Rap music is cool as shit!</p>
<p>Can you imagine if NWA made a song called &ldquo;Screw the police.&rdquo; It would be fucking boring and lame. Good job Donny Osmond, idiots.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand why these things are &ldquo;taboo&rdquo; and why people get offended by it. Swearing is so fucking cool.</p>
<p>One time, I was applying for the fucking military and while I was waiting I could hear this badass motherfucker in the navy swearing constantly. Every fucking sentence was laced with profanity and it was fucking awesome.</p>
<p>I remember thinking&hellip;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why there is a saying that people swear like a sailor!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I imagined myself holding a rifle, shooting at motherfuckers and screaming &ldquo;See you in hell, you fucking assholes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fuck yeah. Swear more, it&rsquo;ll make you cool, fuckface. Stop being a pussy, stop being a god damned prude! Jesus Christ!</p>
<p>Before writing this article, I looked up a god damned list of bad words. The list had &ldquo;Jesus Christ&rdquo; and I was like, &ldquo;Jesus Christ! Jesus Christ is a bad word?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Apparently it is considered blasphemy, which is fucking taboo for some reason. But if you say &ldquo;Praise Jesus Christ&rdquo; or &ldquo;Jesus Christ loves you&rdquo; that is totally fine.</p>
<p>George Carlin ran into problems with his comedy acts in his early years because of his fucking swearing. It wasn&rsquo;t politically correct and the government went after him for it. It wasn&rsquo;t liberals or leftists who had a problem with it. It was the fucking Christians. They ruin everything.</p>
<p><img src="/images/141020-bartini-george-carlin-tease_tcqmfx.avif" alt=""></p>
<p>Now those same people are fucking complaining about &ldquo;Cancel Culture&rdquo; as if respecting pronoun usage is the same thing as banning curse words. Fuck off you stupid bigots.</p>
<p>So why don&rsquo;t you stupid fucks stop being such fucking pussies and just widen your vocabulary by swearing more? It&rsquo;s cool as shit! It&rsquo;s also a sign of being <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/blog/am-i-right/202104/are-people-who-swear-more-honest">fucking honest</a>.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;I never liked you. You know why? You don&rsquo;t curse. I don&rsquo;t trust a man who doesn&rsquo;t curse. Not a &ldquo;fuck&rdquo; or a &ldquo;shit&rdquo; in all these years. Real men curse.&rdquo; -Captain Yardley, Falling Down (Movie).</em></p>
<p>Do you know who didn&rsquo;t swear? <a href="https://forum.axishistory.com/viewtopic.php?t=105964">Hitler</a>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never heard Ted Bundy say a fucking curse word.</p>
<p>People who don&rsquo;t swear are fucking assholes and they&rsquo;re fucking full of shit.</p>
<p>Do you know who does swear? Debra Fucking Morgan! Check out this compilation of her swearing. It&rsquo;s fucking badass.</p>

<p>Some total shitfuck wrote an article that says &quot; <a href="https://www.autodidacts.io/swearing-is-dumb/">Swearing is dumb</a>&quot;. Fuck that asshole, swearing is a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S038800011400151X">sign of intelligence</a>.</p>
<p>Once I worked at Costco during high school so I could buy hamburgers and shit at lunch. It was the Christmas season, and this fucking white racist idiot was all like:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jeeeeeeeeesus Fucking Christ! They should have designated times for <strong><em>these people</em></strong> to shop!&rdquo; while he was making an angry face at immigrants.</p>
<p>He was a stupid racist fuck ( <em><strong>not everyone</strong></em> who swears is fucking smart) but I laughed at that for like 20 god damned years. It certainly made my shitty day much more enjoyable at the time.</p>
<p>If you disagree with this, <strong><em>you&rsquo;re</em></strong> fucking stupid, asshole.</p>
<p>Not only is it cruise control for cool, it&rsquo;s fucking <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health-news/dont-watch-your-mouth-swearing-can-actually-be-good-for-your-health">good for your health</a>!</p>
<p>Eat shit and kiss my ass.</p>
