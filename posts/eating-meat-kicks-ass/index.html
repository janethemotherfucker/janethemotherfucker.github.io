  <h1>Eating meat kicks ass</h1>
   <p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I fucking love animals&hellip;. with the right seasoning.</p>
<p><img src="/images/mouth.avif" alt=""></p>
<p>Enjoy a picture of a stupid animal being eaten.</p>
<p>I was chilling in IRC eating dry roasted BBQ crickets, when some fuckface vegan started calling me a murderer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meat is genocide&rdquo; they kept saying, over and over again, for weeks.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s have a look at the <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/genocide">dictionary</a>:</p>
<p>T <em>he deliberate and systematic destruction of a racial, political, or cultural group</em></p>
<p>What racial, political or cultural group does steak belong to? I&rsquo;ll give you a hint: None of them.</p>
<p>Animals are not people, no matter how much you fucking dumb asses want them to be. The definition of genocide doesn&rsquo;t cover animals so fuck off. Animals don&rsquo;t have any rights except one: the right to be eaten.</p>
<p>It is completely insane for PETA to compare the holocaust with eating meat.</p>
<p>If Animals didn&rsquo;t want to be eaten, they wouldn&rsquo;t be made of meat. It&rsquo;s that simple.</p>
<p><img src="/images/fb_img_1714589813435.avif" alt=""></p>
<p>Look at how fucking delicious that is.</p>
<p>Vegans know how much meat kicks ass because those fuckers are always trying to copy meat. There have been a few good attempts, like Beyond Burgers. But come on, Tofurkey? I&rsquo;d rather eat a dick.</p>
<p>All animals on this planet eat other animals. It is called the food chain and we are on top because we fucking kick ass.</p>
<p>Every year, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041107084521/http://eesc.orst.edu/agcomwebfile/news/food/vegan.html">millions of animals are killed</a> by wheat and soy bean combines during harvesting season.</p>
<p>PETA also has a <a href="https://www.akc.org/press-center/articles-resources/akc-vvma-express-outrage-peta-approach-euthanasia-animal-shelter/">99% kill rate</a> when it comes to its animal shelters. I&rsquo;ve been told that it is just sick and dying animals that the no kill shelters won&rsquo;t accept. That just doesn&rsquo;t make any sense, who is trying to rehome a sick or dying pet?</p>
<p>Why can&rsquo;t PETA sell that meat?</p>
<p>One last point: humans would not have the <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/01/220124151115.htm#:~:text=Quintessential%20human%20traits%20such%20as,shift%20involving%20greater%20meat%20consumption.">brains</a> we do if it weren&rsquo;t for eating meat.</p>
<p>So bring a live cow to the table and let me carve off what I want, and ride the rest home.</p>
<p>Steak kicks ass.</p>
