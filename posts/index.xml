      <description>There is a reason people smoke, because its fucking cool as shit.&#xA;Look at this badass.&#xA;Normally all you hear is negative shit about smoking. But check this badass motherfucker.&#xA;Now for the PSA, smoking cigarettes is very bad for you.&#xA;You should be vaping! Then you don&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about thousands of cancer causing agents. Just a few instead.&#xA;Cool as shit, motherfucker. This is my favourite part of vaping, the massive clouds.</description>

      <title>Techrights is a nazi adjacent cesspool</title>

      <description>It might be a little inaccurate to label the site &amp;ldquo;Nazi&amp;rdquo; when it&amp;rsquo;s really fascist and/or Nazi adjacent. Saying something is adjacent is like saying it&amp;rsquo;s similar, but not quite the same. It&amp;rsquo;s basically in the same area.&#xA;Techrights claims to be progressive but it isn&amp;rsquo;t. When has Techrights ever leaned left?&#xA;This is from 2011:&#xA;Citation Link&#xA;Techrights is always writing shitty articles based on disinformation and bald faced lies but they covered a leak of Redhat&amp;rsquo;s hiring guidelines.</description>

      <description>Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, I fucking love animals&amp;hellip;. with the right seasoning.&#xA;Enjoy a picture of a stupid animal being eaten.&#xA;I was chilling in IRC eating dry roasted BBQ crickets, when some fuckface vegan started calling me a murderer.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Meat is genocide&amp;rdquo; they kept saying, over and over again, for weeks.&#xA;Let&amp;rsquo;s have a look at the dictionary:&#xA;T he deliberate and systematic destruction of a racial, political, or cultural group</description>

      <description>Computers are too easy to use. I think Steve Jobs and Bill Gates did disservice to the computer industry. Some people are saying I&amp;rsquo;m wrong and that it&amp;rsquo;s Apple and Microsoft that made computers what they are today. I say they are wrong. Apple and Microsoft may be putting out these innovative solutions but they are not creating them.&#xA;Microsoft does not make products, it buys them and makes changes to them so they are more user friendly, insecure and inferior to competing products.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m going to start this article off by saying that you don&amp;rsquo;t have to be born in the boomer generation to be a boomer. You can be a boomer by acting like one. Hate new stuff? boomer. Run a desktop from the naughties? Boomer.&#xA;That&amp;rsquo;s right fuckface.&#xA;Linux Boomers are people who act like boomers because they hate new things. They thought the naughties were the pinnacle of technology and say OSS was the best.</description>

      <description>I see a lot of fucking hate aimed at the transgender community by assholes and shitheads. And sometimes these shitheads make a video of a trans person freaking out.&#xA;Don&amp;rsquo;t freak out. You don&amp;rsquo;t want to be put on blast by fascists.&#xA;I have a better solution.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Hello Sir, how can I help you?&amp;rdquo; says some guy&#xA;&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m not a Sir&amp;rdquo; says a trans woman&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t give me that gender nonsense.</description>

      <description>That&amp;rsquo;s right, fuckface!&#xA;&amp;ldquo;uuuououououo thats offensive!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Fuck off.&#xA;There is nothing fucking wrong with using &amp;ldquo;bad words&amp;rdquo; and in fact, they add some god damned emphasis and make your use of language so much more badass.&#xA;The best music and movies are full of profanity. Rap music is cool as shit!&#xA;Can you imagine if NWA made a song called &amp;ldquo;Screw the police.&amp;rdquo; It would be fucking boring and lame. Good job Donny Osmond, idiots.</description>

      <description>I was reading some nonsense from the fuckfaces over at the Stallman Support website. They attempt to apologize for Stallman&amp;rsquo;s shitty behavior by explaining away why he is such a fucking monster.&#xA;Just take a second to read this bullshit., dipshit&#xA;First paragraph: abort fetuses that have Down&amp;rsquo;s syndrome&#xA;This is fucking eugenics bruh, plain and fucking simple. I&amp;rsquo;m not arguing about the definition of a person here motherfucker, I&amp;rsquo;m arguing against eugenics.</description>
